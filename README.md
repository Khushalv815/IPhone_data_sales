In this project, I analyzed various categories and their ratings, focusing on insightful patterns and trends within the data. By leveraging technologies such as Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Plotly, I was able to visualize key metrics and bring the analysis to life through dynamic visualizations. This project has strengthened my skills in data manipulation, analysis, and storytelling through data visualization.
